The Albums Downloader
=====================

The Albums Downloader is a very simple and efficient desktop application that easily allows you to download your favourite albums or pictures of your friends or your favourite celebrity or sports team page that you follow on Facebook.

The Albums Downloader has been designed keeping in mind simplicity and the ease of use. With minimum number of clicks and types you can have an entire album downloaded straight to your PC. Simple enough! Itâ€™s not just restricted to the albums uploaded by the user on his/her Facebook profile. You can also download the tagged photos of your friends and even better, get those awesome photos uploaded by your favorite pages.
With the newly introduced search feature, you can now search for your friends, albums and pages you are interested in. Hence, there is no longer any need to scroll down all the way to search for that particular friend or album. You can open multiple albums at a time and if you are not interested in downloading the entire album, you have the option to select specific photos. If network bandwidth is an issue, you can choose to disable loading images for the thumbnails or can switch between downloading high/medium quality photos.
